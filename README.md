# Deasciifier-CLI-and-AHK
This is a simple command line interface and autohotkey script for Turkish deasciifier, based on https://github.com/meacer/deasciifier.

**To configure**: Install python onto cmd terminal and install autohotkey. Double click on deasciifier-v3.ahk to run the hotkey script in the background.

**To use**: highlight any text. CTRL+ALT+T will replace the current highlighted text with the deasciified version. CTRL+ALT+K will place the deasciified version in your clipboard. Therefore, note that the latter will overwrite your clipboard, whereas the former will not.

**Dependencies**: Python 3, AHK version >= 2.0

**My contributions**:
1) updated deeasciifier python syntax and encodings to be up-to-date with python 3.
2) exposed the deasciifier via a command line interface.
3) used the command line interface to create a hotkey script.
